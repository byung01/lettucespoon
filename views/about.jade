                            p I live to eat, and I eat to live. LettuceSpoon is where I combine my interests in delicious foods and balanced nutrition. I am Linda Yung, a Registered Dietitian and masters of Food Policy and Applied Nutrition from Tufts Friedman. I am a die-hard New Yorker with lofty goals of changing the ways Americans perceive food. I can also be described as an aspiring jet-setter, amateur tai chi master, and novice stargazer. On the real, I enjoy meandering through foreign markets, I spend too much time reading science fiction, and I experiment a lot in the kitchen. I hope Lettuce Spoon will provide you with some insight on my gastronomic lifestyle and perhaps a pinch of inspiration as well.
                            p Do you have any questions on the recipes? Don't know what you should be eating for breakfast? Need a recommendation for where to eat on a first date? Don't hesitate to contact me!

Because although eating honey was  a very good thing to do, there was a moment just before you began to eat it which was better than when you were, but he didn't know what it was called.
